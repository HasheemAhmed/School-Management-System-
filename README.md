This repository contains a C++ program for a School Management System. The program allows for the management of student records, including updating student information.

## Features

🔄 **Update Student Information**: The program provides functionality to update existing student records by entering the student's roll number.

📂 **File Handling**: Uses file I/O operations to read and write student data from/to `student.txt`.

## Getting Started

### Follow the On-Screen Instructions:

1. Enter the student's roll number to update their information.
2. Provide the new details as prompted.

## File Structure

- `SchoolManagementSystem.cpp`: The main C++ source file containing the program logic.
- `student.txt`: The file where student records are stored. This file should be present in the same directory as the executable.

### Example `student.txt` Format
